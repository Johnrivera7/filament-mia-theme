## Name

Mía

## Tagline (one line)

A warm editorial theme for Filament v5, for panels that are part of the product.

## Short description (directory card)

Cream and champagne in the light, espresso in the dark, with a high-contrast
serif for headings. Every surface is set by hand — type scale, spacing,
hierarchy, borders, motion, focus — rather than derived from an accent colour.
Ships pre-compiled, so there is no build step to install.

## Long description (listing body)

Mía is not a palette swap. Feeding an accent colour into Filament's defaults
changes the hue and leaves the rest of the design intact. This theme rewrites
the component layer: type scale, spacing, hierarchy, borders, shadows, motion,
focus rings and empty states.

Three things carry it.

**A real editorial voice.** Headings are set in a high-contrast display serif
and content in a geometric humanist sans. Column headings, group labels and
stat captions are small, in caps and widely tracked.

**A dark mode that is actually warm.** Not a cool grey inversion — espresso,
taupe and deep umber, built from the same neutral ramp as the light mode.

**Restraint as a feature.** Hairline borders at very low contrast, wide diffuse
shadows tinted with the neutral rather than black, generous radii, and motion
slow enough to feel deliberate, honouring `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Colour, typography, roundness, density and elevation are configurable at
runtime through a fluent API and resolved as CSS custom properties, so
reconfiguring the theme never requires recompiling it.

Contrast is measured, not assumed: every text and UI pair meets WCAG AA. The
suite runs against PHP 8.4 and 8.5.

Mía is ready for production and published as a stable Packagist release in the
`0.2` series. The version stays under `1.0` so the public surface may still
evolve; every change is listed in the changelog.

## Notes for whoever submits this

- Capitalise "Filament" and "FilamentPHP" exactly as written above.
- No superlatives about the author or the project.
- Do not add the personal narrative behind the name. Design terms only.
- The images the form asks for are under `art/`, both produced by
  `bin/listing-shots.mjs` from the demo panel, in light mode as the form
  requires. Never from a real system.
  - **Main image** — `art/listing-cover.jpg`, 2560×1440.
  - **Thumbnail** — `art/listing-thumbnail.jpg`, 1280×720. Worth uploading
    because it is a different picture rather than the same one scaled: a whole
    panel shrunk to that size is a grey rectangle, so the thumbnail drops the
    lede, three of the pills and one of the screens, and draws what is left
    larger.
